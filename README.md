# Crypto Traders

Sorry the apps are dead, jjxtra changed away from what was built and Poloniex stopped serving US customers so development halted.  Solutions left for reference purposes only.

Are Windows Desktop applications that allow you to trade faster, smarter.  

Key Features are Cost Averager, Click books to set price. Buy Sell Cancel operations. 

API does not require login, no picking sidewalks and busses, or confirming my dynamic IP.   

Refresh buttons for balance, trade histoy, Open Order listings.

Alt-Coin Crypto Traders based upon [jjxtra Exchange Sharp Library](https://github.com/jjxtra/ExchangeSharp).  

Writeups about the components and details are in the wiki.

Utilizes my own fork of the library to override the balance function.
